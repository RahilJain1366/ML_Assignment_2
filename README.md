# ML_Assignment_2

In this project, we focus on building a PyTorch Dataset class and implementing a YOLO-style object detector for detecting a cracker box in images.

**Install the python packages:** ``pip install -r requirement.txt``

**For obtaining the training loss:** ``run the train.py script``

**For obtaining the test average precision:** ``run the test.py script``
